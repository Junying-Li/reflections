## Introduction
Not many people can manage to create beautiful things with unfortunate data and information. Itâ€™s especially impactful when the data artist has a personal story and reason behind their visualization.

A View of Despair is a beautiful visualization by Sonja Kuijpers. It tells the story of all the people who took their life in The Netherlands in 2017. Each natural symbol represents how life was lost, along with the size representing age. ALso, there are several line charts to show trend of the amount of suicides, methods of suicides, and suicides per agegroup.

Sometimes, the best data visualizations are the ones that tell a personal, relatable story.
